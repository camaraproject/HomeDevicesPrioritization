**User Story: Configure traffic profile (DSCP)**
<br>

| **Item** | **Details** |
| ---- | ------- |
| ***Summary*** | As an application developer belonging to an enterprise, I want to request (using my application server/backend service) specific QoS behaviours (service classes) to be configured at my end-user's home WiFi access point to ensure the required quality of experience I need for my service/app.  |
| ***Roles, Actors and Scope*** | **Roles:** Customer:User<br> **Actors:** Application service providers, hyperscalers, application developers. <br> **Scope:** Configure QoS behaviours to ensure needed quality of experience for a given device within a residential LAN. The expected behaviour is that the target device is the same device where the app is running. |
| ***Pre-conditions*** |The preconditions are listed below:<br><ol><li>The end-user is connected to a residential WiFi access point.</li><li>The end-user is running an application/service developed by the customer (application developer) that includes calls to the API.</li><li>Security and privacy requirements are fulfilled as defined in Commonalities.</li></ol>|
| ***Activities/Steps*** | **Starts when:** The server/backend service calls the API specifying the service class required and the target device.<br>**Ends when:** The requested QoS behaviour (service class) has been configured and the server/backend has being informed about it.<br> |
| ***Post-conditions*** | Service class is applied and customer (application developer) app/service continues.<br>Note that default QoS behaviour could be restored on back-end side at a given frequency (e.g. daily) or on demand by customer doing another call to the API.|
| ***Exceptions*** | Several exceptions might occur during the Home Devices QoD API operations<br><ul><li>Unauthorized: Not valid credentials (e.g. use of already expired access token).</li><li>Invalid input: Not valid input data to invoke operation (e.g. invalid IP address, invalid service class, etc).</li><li>Denied by carrier: QoS behaviour cannot be implemented (already too many QoS behaviours configured, device is not connected to the required interface, etc), Server error, Service unavailable, request time exceeded, etc.</li></ul> |
