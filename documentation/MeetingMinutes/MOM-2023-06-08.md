| **Open Issues** | |
|  | <li>~~[#18](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/18) "v0.2.0 - Update API documentation according to v0.2.0 API version"~~<br>CLOSED. This issue was addressed in PR ~~[#38]((https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/pull/38))~~ which has already been merged. The PR updates the API documentation according to v0.2.0 API version definition, including changes from v0.1.0 release, and adds the documentation to the API definition as discussed in issue [#64](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/164) of Commonalities. This PR is in line with what it is being done in other subprojects (such as [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/151)).<ul><li>This was the only remaining change before closing and creating the v0.2.0 release on github.</ul> |
|  | [#39](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/39) "Generation of release v1.0.0"<br>Issue to validate and meet API readiness requirements to generate a first stable API release v1.0.0 from v0.2.0. No further functionality will be added to the API.  The requirements in order to generate a release v1.0.0 in CAMARA APIs are being discussed in Commonalities (Issue [#139](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/139)). The corresponding release v1.0.0 would be generated in the github project.<ul><li>~~PR [#40](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/39) - "Creation of API readiness checklist document (Issue 39)"~~<br>MERGED. The "home_devices_qod_readiness_checklist.md" document with the API readiness status [is now available](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/blob/main/documentation/API_documentation/home_devices_qod_readiness_checklist.md) as done in the [QualityOnDemand project](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/API_documentation/QoD-API-Readiness-Checklist.md)<li>The requirement to fulfill step 5 ("API test cases and documentation") of the API Readiness checklist is being discussed in issue [#61](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/61) of Commonalities. Need to confirm mandatory deliverable(s) and whether it is good enough to provide the ".feature" file or not.</ul> |
| **New Issues** |  |
|  | [#41](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/41) "WiFi QoS Mappings"<br>Open by DT (Rafal), it is intended to refer to [RFC8325](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8325) in the documentation as the standard reference for WiFi downstream. From Telefonica's point of view, there is no need to do this as the current API design is not related to RFC8325 or IEEE 802.11 UP (User Priority). The current proposal is based on the DSCP value set in the user's home router to control the QoS behaviour of the target home device's IP traffic. And it has been defined the "service class" concept on top of DSCP to provide a developer-friendly design following RFC4594 recommendations. So existing documented service class mapping to DSCP should be sufficient. |
| **AOB** | |
|  | <li>Next Home Devices QoD community call on June 21st, UTC 16:00, CET 17:00 |


## Next Steps

* Create issue and PR to generate v0.2.0 release on github.
* Continue discussion on issue #39 "Generation of release v1.0.0". <ul><li>If providing a ".feature" file is confirmed as the minimum mandatory deliverable, then create PR to provide the ".feature" file as the API test cases definition.</ul>
* Close discussion on issue #41 "WiFi QoS Mappings".
