| Agenda Item | Description | 
| ----------- | ------------|
| **Recap/Updates** |  |
|  | <li>API doc updates for API version 0.2.0 being included in branch `dev-v0.2.0` (new issue [#18](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/18)). |
| **Open Issues** | |
|  | [#2](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/2) ~~Pending API update related to CAMARA commonalities issue [#101](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/101).~~<br>CLOSED. The corresponding CAMARA Commonalities track has been closed with some agreements but not a unique traversal solution. Each API we work on will need to consider additional requirements (if any) to decide which identifiers makes the most sense. So far, in case of Home Devices QoD current definition, it's assumed user authentication (3-legged token). And the user and home network information are deducted from the information included in the access token. There is no user identifier filed included in the API request body. |
|  | [#3](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/3) Maintainers.<br>To be CLOSED as soon DT contact/s are 100% confirmed. <br><ul><li>[Current Maintainers](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.MD)</ul>Working with Noel Wirzius to get technical contact/s from DT and to get them involved in github project and API design. He was expected to provide information during this days. Still no confirmation received from him. So far Rafal Artych (representing DT) is joining weekly calls. He has confirmed that he is speaking with Noel already and next week they hope to be able to confirm who the contact person/s will be. |
| **New Issues** |  |
|  | [#18](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/18) Update API documentation according to v0.2.0 API version <br>Being addressed in PR [#19](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/pull/19). Updates included so far corresponds to: <ul><li>PR [#13](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/pull/13) "*dev-v0.2.0 - Aligment with API Design Guidelines Commonality - Add "status" field in error definitions*".<li>PR [#14](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/pull/14) "*Add 403 specific API error when User home network cannot be deducted from access token*".</ul>|
|  | [#20](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/20) Update commonalities glossary with HomeDevicesQoD-subproject relevant terms <br>It is related to Commonalities issue [#120](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/120).</ul>|
