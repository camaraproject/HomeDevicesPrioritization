From release v0.2.0, work will begin to generate the first stable API version v1.0.0 by contributing with the API test cases definition.<li>New Issue #46 "Add option to apply QoD to subnets" |
| **Open Issues** | |
|  | [#39](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/39) "Generation of release v1.0.0"<br>Issue to validate and meet API readiness requirements to generate a first stable API release v1.0.0 from v0.2.0. No further functionality will be added to the API.<ul><li>The requirement to fulfill step 5 ("API test cases and documentation") of the API Readiness checklist has been agreed in issue [#61](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/61) of Commonalities. It has been confirmed that it is good enough to provide the ".feature" file.</ul> |
|  | ~~[#41](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/41) "WiFi QoS Mappings"~~<br>CLOSED  in view of the comments provided and the fact that there are no further objections.<br>The current proposal is based on the DSCP value set in the user's home router to control the QoS behaviour of the target home device's IP traffic. And it has been defined the "service class" concept on top of DSCP to provide a developer-friendly design following RFC4594 recommendations. So existing documented service class mapping to DSCP should be sufficient. |
|  | ~~[#44](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/44) "Generation of release v0.2.0"~~<br>CLOSED<br>Addressed in PR [#45](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/pull/45) which has been already merged. Release [v0.2.0](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/releases/tag/v0.2.0) is now available. |
| **New Issues** |  |
|  | [#46](https://github.com/camaraproject/HomeDevicesQoD/issues/46) "Add option to apply QoD to subnets"<br>Open by Cablelabs (Randy Levensalor), it is intended to suggest an API enhancement to apply QoD to home subnets.<br>This would be a new functionality, so formal procedure through GSMA OGW Product WS must be followed since GSMA is the one that manages priorities at the product level.<br>From Telefónica perspective, suggested feature is probably more appropriate for an internal Operator application, where the user has a "control panel" or similar to manage their home network resources, devices and configurations (including subnets). But in the CAMARA context, where Operator exposes APIs to third party developers, the subnet information may not be known/accessible to the developer (exposed information is limited).|
| **AOB** | |
|  | <li>Next Home Devices QoD community call on July 20th, UTC 16:00, CET 17:00 |


## Next Steps

* Create PR to provide the ".feature" file as the API test cases definition.</ul>
