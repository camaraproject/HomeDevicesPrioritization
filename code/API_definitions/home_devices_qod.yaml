  title: Home Devices QoD - DRAFT VERSION
  description: |-
    Service Enabling Network Function API for *QoS-on-demand* (QoD) control applied to devices connected to the user home network. API clients can request to change on demand DSCP value for the IP traffic corresponding to a specific user home device.

    # Relevant Definitions and concepts

    - **Home Devices**: user devices connected to the user home network.
    - **NaaS**: *Network-as-a-Service* model where Telco Network resources are exposed to third parties through APIs. In this particular API, QoD operations for home devices are exposed following this model.
    - **DSCP**: *Differentiated Services (DiffServ) Code Point*. DiffServ is a simple and scalable mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and providing quality of service (QoS) on IP networks. The DSCP value will be used to classify the traffic of the target home device in order to be treated accordingly.

    # API Functionality

    This API allows to third party clients to set on demand the DSCP value associated to the traffic of the device connected to the user home network matching the input criteria provided. Device traffic will be classified and treated accordingly.
     
    - **NOTE: This API allows to apply QoS treatment for a target user device only within user Home Network** 

    # Resources and Operations overview

    The API provides a single endpoint:
     
    - An endpoint to set the desired DSCP value for the traffic corresponding to the user device matching the input criteria.

      summary: Set the desired DSCP value for a user home device
      description: |-
        Set the desired DSCP value for the traffic corresponding to the user home device matching the input criteria. **Setting DSCP value to CS0 restores default traffic treatment for the target home device.**
        
        - The operation is executed for the user whose `sub` is in the access token used to call this endpoint, and for the home network also deducted from the information included in the access token.
        - The target user device is identified by the internal IP address of that device in the home network.
        - In case there is no device matching the input criteria, the operation returns a 404 error.
